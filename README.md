The Smart Home Energy System (SHES) is a simulation platform that models and optimizes household energy usage. 
It integrates solar panels, batteries, consumers, a utility grid, and an electric vehicle charger into a unified system. 
SHES enables realâ€‘time and accelerated simulation of energy production, storage, and consumption, while allowing user input for weather conditions and device control. 
The system collects data, manages battery charge/discharge, handles surplus/deficit energy with the utility, and produces daily reports with charts and cost analysis, making it a powerful tool for testing smart home energy strategies.
